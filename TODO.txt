Desired Features for PDI Prompt Step Plugin
===========================================

Below is a list of some of the features that would fit well with the design
goals of this plugin but which have not yet been implemented.  They are ideas
for future improvements and anyone with interest is encouraged to consider
implementing any of these features:

# Text-based prompt strategies

Such strategies could be chosen for transformations which are intended to be
run from the command-line.

# Remote prompt strategies

There is currently no support for remote execution.  It would be great
if there were some way to prompt remotely.  I (Kevin) have no experience with
remote transformations and it is not a priority for me, but I recognize this
may be highly valuable for users where this is a common use case.

# Preserve types for choice-based prompts

Currently all prompt results are String values.  I (Kevin) contend that this
is the correct result for text-entry prompts and that any data conversion
should be done by subsequent steps.  However, for choice-based prompts it would
be preferable to preserve the type of the choice values to avoid the need to
re-convert them back to their original types.

The choice-based prompt strategies are written to support different value
data-types using generics, but the code for utilizing the strategies currently
treats all values as strings and store the resulting data in a string field.
